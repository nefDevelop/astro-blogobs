# Welcome to Vault CMS

## Run the setup wizard

If you just installed Vault CMS, the most important step is running the wizard. It will detect your Astro theme and configure your content types automatically.

> [!TIP]
> **Command**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and search for **"Vault CMS: Open Wizard"** if you closed it.

## The CMS home base

We use a custom Obsidian bases view to give you a bird's-eye view of your content.

> [!NOTE]
> Click the **Home** icon in your tab bar or open the `_bases/Home.base` file to see your content in a grid view.

## Key workflows

- **Writing**: hust use `Ctrl/Cmd + N` to create a new file using your default content type and start writing.
- **Publishing**: use the **Git: Push** command (or click the up arrow in the status bar) to send your changes live to your Astro site.
